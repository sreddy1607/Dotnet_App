Hi Srinivas, please see the following information from Cognos (ref Exporting tenant content to a deployment archive - IBM Documentation):

 

Setting the Encryption Password

During the export process, in the Deployment Wizard (whether for tenant content or general content):
You'll reach a step labeled "Specify a deployment archive".
Under the Encryption section, click "Set the encryption password".
Enter and confirm your desired password.
Click OK to apply it
This password will be required later when importing the deployment archive into another Cognos environment.
Important Notes:
There is no default encryption password. You must manually set one during the export process.
If you forget the password, the encrypted archive cannot be imported, so be sure to store it securely.
 

Does this help?  If not, please schedule a meeting at 3 so we can walk through the process to research further and/or open a case with SaaS if necessary.
