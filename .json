Subject: Request to Enable Service Account for Cognos Deployments via MotioCI

 

Hi Admin & Team,

 

I am working on automating Cognos deployments through MotioCI.

The MotioCI authentication (API token) is working fine, but the pipeline is failing during the deploy step with the error:

 

DEPLOYMENT_AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: failed to authenticate to instance with ID [X]

 

This happens when MotioCI tries to log into the target Cognos instance (DEV/TEST and PROD) using the service account.

 

 

Could you please help confirm the following for the service account

 CMarksSS01@intra.dhs.ca.gov:

 

--Namespace ID:

 

What is the exact namespaceId we should use for DEV/TEST and for PROD?

 

(Is it Azure AD, AzureAD, or something else? Case and spaces matter.) Azure for both

 

--Account Status:

 

Ensure this service account is enabled, password is valid (not expired), and no MFA/interactive login is required. Is enabled in Azure, Do not have password for this account, MFA unknown

 

Confirm it can log in directly to the Cognos portal in both environments.

 

--Permissions:

 

Does the service account have the required Cognos roles/permissions to perform deployments via MotioCI for project Demo? Yes, it is a Cognos Administrator
